# Biomechanics-Pitching-Project

This project was a combined class and personal project. The purpose of the class project was to analyze biomechanics of motion from data recorded with IMU and force plate sensors. I took this opportunity to use my collegiate softball athletes and analyze their pitching to determine which has the strongest correlation to pitch speed; tangential arm angular velocity, drive force from their push off leg or their stride length. Python scripts were written to process and analyze the data from the sensors.
